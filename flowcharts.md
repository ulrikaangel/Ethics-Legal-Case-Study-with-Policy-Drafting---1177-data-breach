The diagram illustrates the complete incident response workflow, beginning with the detection of an incident and its internal reporting. The security administrator then performs an initial assessment to determine what has occurred and whether patient data has been affected. Based on this assessment, the process decides whether the incident is critical. Non-critical incidents are handled locally and documented. Critical incidents are escalated to the incident response team, who isolate affected systems, mitigate the risk, and collect evidence such as logs. Once the situation is stabilized, operations are restored and a formal analysis is carried out. The process concludes with a final report summarizing findings and recommending improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Illustration of how patient data and communication flow securely between regions, 1177, service providers, and technical subcontractors. 
The management of information within the 1177 service for the Regions of Stockholm, Värmland, and Sörmland is organized through a structured chain of responsibility. While the regions hold overall accountability, the 1177 platform is operated by Inera AB on their behalf. 

Patient communication is handled by MedHelp, which acts as the healthcare provider and manages personal data. MedHelp uses a technical subcontractor that must comply with EU regulations, including GDPR, and all digital communication is encrypted to ensure data protection. 

System hosting and storage are provided by Voice Integrate Nordic AB and Voice NAS, which operate as data processors and are required to meet contractual and legal security requirements.
