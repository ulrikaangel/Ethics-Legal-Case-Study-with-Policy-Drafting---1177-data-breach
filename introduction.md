In 2019, one of the largest privacy incidents in Swedish healthcare came to light: the 1177 data leak. Hundreds of thousands of calls to the 1177 Vårdguiden healthcare advisory service dating back to 2013, had been stored on a server that was openly accessible on the internet, without any protective measures such as encryption, authentication, or access control. The calls contained highly sensitive personal information about individuals’ health, and the incident was first uncovered through journalistic investigation rather than internal security monitoring (Computer Sweden, 2019)  

The incident stemmed from a complex and poorly managed supply chain. Three regions, Stockholm, Sörmland, and Värmland, had outsourced private telephone-based healthcare advice via MedHelp Care AB. MedHelp, in turn, employed a Thai subcontractor, MediCall AB, to handle parts of the call advisory service. The technical platform was provided by another subcontractor, Voice Integrate Sweden AB, whose server misconfiguration led to the exposure (IMY, 2021, p. 2–3). This chain of outsourcing created unclear responsibilities and insufficient oversight, leaving no single actor fully in control of the personal data processing. 

The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) determined that several laws and regulations had been violated. The regions and suppliers breached key provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and violated the Swedish Patient Data Act, which imposes strict requirements on handling personal data in healthcare (IMY, 2021, p. 5-6).  

In total, there were 2.7 million audio files, corresponding to an estimated 650,000–900,000 calls that were exposed (IMY, 2021, p. 3). Many of these contained especially sensitive information, such as personal identification numbers, addresses, medical conditions, mental health data, and details about children’s health. 

The 1177 data leak remains highly relevant today, as it demonstrates how digitalization and outsourcing can create significant privacy risks if organizations do not maintain full control over their supply chains. The incident serves as a clear reminder that data protection responsibility cannot be delegated, and that both technical and organizational security measures must be enforced when handling sensitive personal information. In an era of increasingly digital and international healthcare, the lessons from the 1177 case are crucial for preventing similar incidents in the future. 

Encryption is a fundamental security measure within information security and involves transforming information into an unreadable format that can only be interpreted by authorized users with the correct key (IMY, 2023). The purpose of encryption is to protect information from unauthorized access, both during storage and during data transmission. This is particularly important when it comes to sensitive personal data, for example within healthcare, where insufficient protection may lead to serious consequences for an individual's privacy. According to IMY, encryption is an important measure for meeting the requirements for information security under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as it reduces the risk of information being disclosed, intercepted, or used without authorization (IMY, 2023).  

Personal data is any information that can identify an individual, such as name, personal number, or medical records (IMY, 2023). Health data is considered especially sensitive and requires extra protection. The GDPR regulates how personal data must be handled security, lawfully and fairly. Organizations must implement measures like encryption to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure (IMY, 2023). Non-compliance can lead to privacy breaches and legal consequences.   

According to NIST SP 800-92, logging and continuous security monitoring are essential components of incident detection and security investigations. The guideline emphasizes that log data is the most critical sources for identifying security incidents, policy violations and suspicious activities. Without sufficient logging, it can complicate or prevent investigations, it is not possible to determine whether a data breach has occurred, what actions an attacker has taken, how long the intrusion may have lasted, or which system has been affected. (NIST, 2006) 

These aspects are clearly illustrated in the 1177 incident. Had effective monitoring and log management been in place, the misconfigured server would likely have been detected earlier. The case demonstrates how the absence of structured logging not only delays the detection of security incidents but also makes any investigations afterwards more difficult. NIST’s guidelines emphasize that robust logging and monitoring are fundamental components of preventive cybersecurity, but also essential for IT-forensic investigations.
