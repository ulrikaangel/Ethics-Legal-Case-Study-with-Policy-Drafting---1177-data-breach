ChatGPT has been used as a supporting tool during the writing process of this project. AI was applied mainly to assist with languange grammar and structure. It was not used to generate any factual content. 

All factual information are based on the attached sources, mainly from reports from the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY), GDPR and the Patient Data Act. The reason for choosing Chat GPT instead of any other LLMs such as Ollama, because the training of such models would have been to inefficient for this project. The authors had a clear vision of how the tool would be used, and all material provided to ChatGPT are derived from publicy available sources. No sensitive or confidential information has been submitted to the tool.

An example of a prompt:

This is my method part. Kan you make the english better in terms of grammar and flow? Don't add any information. 

In the project, we have chosen to use a qualitative case study where our analysis is based on publicly available text material. Our method is based on document analysis and policy analysis. 

For the document analysis, reports from the Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY), formerly the Swedish Data Protection Authority, have been reviewed, taking into account various legal frameworks (GDPR and the Patient Data Act). We have also analyzed articles from Computer Sweden, the news source that published the 1177 incident. In addition, other public sources have been reviewed.
*Add scientific sources if we find them*
This method has been chosen to get a comprehensive picture of the incident, its causes, chain of responsibility and which regulatory violations were committed. The positive thing about the method is that we can get hold of detailed information that can actually be verified. The weakness is that it is only based on already available material. We have also not gained any insight into the internal processes as these have not been published.

For the policy analysis, we have analyzed the content of ISO 27002 and used this standard as a starting point when we identified which technical controls were missing in the incident. The framework is internationally accepted and provides a structured and coherent basis for policy development. Starting from ISO 27002 has given us structured guidance. The limitation, however, is that the standard needs to be interpreted for this specific case, which means that our subjectivity could not be completely avoided.

The method combination of case study with document analysis and policy analysis is appropriate in our case as it would not have been ethically justifiable to reproduce this incident practically."
