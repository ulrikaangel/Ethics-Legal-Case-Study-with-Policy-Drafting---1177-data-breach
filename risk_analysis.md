Risk Analysis 

This section presents an analysis of the risks that materialized during the incident, highlighting the actors involved, the chain of responsibility, breaches of regulatory requirements, and the technical and organizational deficiencies that contributed to the event. 

 

Actors and Chain of Responsibility 

Several actors were involved in the incident, each with different responsibilities regarding the secure processing of personal data.  

Regions: Region Stockholm, Region Sörmland, and Region Värmland were directly linked to the incident. As data controllers, the regions held ultimate responsibility for secure data handling. IMY found that some of this responsibility was diluted within the supplier chain (IMY,2021. p. 2) 

MedHelp Care AB: Serving as the main contractor, MedHelp was responsible for organizational management, personnel, and certain equipment. IMY identified shortcomings in supplier management, data processing agreements, and oversight of subcontractors (IMY,2021. p. 2). 

MediCall AB: A Thai company that performed parts of the healthcare advisory service and processed sensitive patient data outside the EU. In some instances, MediCall acted as if it were the data controller, contrary to legal requirements. Additionally, processing in a third country required specific safeguards that were not implemented (IMY, 2021. p. 2). 

Voice Integrate Sweden AB: Responsible for the technical platform storing the calls, Voice Integrate exhibited deficiencies in basic security measures, protection of sensitive data, and the implementation of security routines (IMY, 2021. p. 2–3). 

The overall chain of responsibility was:  

Regions → MedHelp → MediCall → Voice Integrate 

Delegating responsibility across multiple layers weakened control over the processing of personal data, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. 

 

Regulatory Breaches 

IMY identified breaches of several regulatory frameworks, demonstrating the legal risks associated with inadequate data protection practices: 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Article 5, 28, 32 (IMY, 2021. p.5) 

Patient Data Act (2008:355): Deficiencies in handling, protecting, and logging patient data. 

National Board of Health and Welfare Regulations (SOSFS 2008:14): Deviations in record-keeping, access control, and secure processing. 

 

Causes of the Incident 

The incident is classified as unauthorized access, where sensitive patient data became accessible to external parties. A misconfiguration in Voice Integrate’s server allowed unencrypted communication, making files freely accessible online to anyone with knowledge of the server’s IP address (IMY, 2021, p. 3). 

IMY identified a combination of technical and organizational deficiencies that contributed to the risk.  

The incident was driven by a combination of technical and organizational deficiencies. On the technical side, communication was transmitted unencrypted, fundamental security configurations were insufficient, and logging and monitoring were largely absent. From an organizational perspective, responsibilities between the different actors were unclear, oversight of subcontractors was inadequate, risk analyses had not been performed, and governance and follow-up of outsourced operations were insufficient 

The combination of these deficiencies created a situation where the incident persisted for several years without detection, highlighting the critical risks posed by insufficient technical and organizational controls.
